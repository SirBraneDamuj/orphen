## SCR notes

Expanded tracked IDs (added 0x119C, 0x0526, 0x0534, 0x053D).
Signature classification (SIG_A_9e0c011e0b, SIG_B_0b0b02920c) for seeded id04_records.
Full enumeration enumerate_all_id04 with lightweight classes (A, B, UNK).
Counts summary: A=274, B=1 (the 0x133F case), UNK=230.
Seeded id04_records now 9 (newly captured additional seeded IDs).
Observations:

Signature A (9e0c011e0b) is dominant for these subproc IDs.
Only one Signature B instance (the earlier distinctive 0x133F container).

> SIG_B_0b0b02920c
> Only one Signature B instance (the earlier distinctive 0x133F container).

0x133F is the subproc that is basically "permanent" in the opening map. Maybe this indicates some kind of permanent subproc?

4508 = 0x119C - CUTSCENE ADVANCER?

I noticed this subproc flashes on screen briefly a lot whenever characters advance their dialog. Maybe this subproc is responsible for advancing the dialogue or other control stuff?
