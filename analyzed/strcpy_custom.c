/*
 * Function Analysis: FUN_00268558 -> strcpy_custom
 * Original Location: 0x00268558
 *
 * ANALYSIS:
 * This function implements a standard string copy operation, equivalent to strcpy() from the C standard library.
 * It copies characters from a source string to a destination string until it encounters a null terminator.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 * - param_1: Destination string buffer (char*)
 * - param_2: Source string to copy from (char*)
 *
 * BEHAVIOR:
 * 1. Reads each character from the source string (param_2)
 * 2. Copies it to the destination buffer (param_1)
 * 3. Advances both pointers
 * 4. Continues until it copies the null terminator ('\0')
 * 5. The null terminator is included in the copy, properly terminating the destination string
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - This is an unsafe string copy function (like strcpy) with no bounds checking
 * - The destination buffer must be large enough to hold the entire source string plus null terminator
 * - Buffer overflow is possible if destination is too small
 * - This is a common pattern in PS2 game code where custom string functions were often implemented
 *   instead of using standard library functions
 *
 * SUGGESTED RENAME: strcpy_custom or string_copy

// Analyzed version with improved naming and comments
void strcpy_custom(char *dest, char *src)
{
  char currentChar;

  do
  {
    currentChar = *src;  // Read character from source
    src = src + 1;       // Advance source pointer
    *dest = currentChar; // Write character to destination
    dest = dest + 1;     // Advance destination pointer
  } while (currentChar != '\0'); // Continue until null terminator is copied
  return;
}

/*
 * EQUIVALENT STANDARD C CODE:
 *
 * char* strcpy(char* dest, const char* src) {
 *     char* original_dest = dest;
 *     while ((*dest++ = *src++) != '\0');
 *     return original_dest;
 * }
 *
 * The decompiled version is slightly more verbose but functionally identical.
 * The main differences are:
 * 1. Uses a temporary variable to store the current character
 * 2. Explicit pointer arithmetic instead of combined operations
 * 3. Returns void instead of returning the destination pointer
