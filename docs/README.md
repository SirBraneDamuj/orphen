## Quick Reference

### Key Memory Addresses

- **Debug Output Control**: `0x003555dc` (Master enable flag)
- **Scene Work Flags**: `0x0031e770` (128-bit flag array)
- **Current Selection**: `0x00355128` (Selected flag index)

### Analysis Status

- **Debug Menu System**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Scene Work Display**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **Mini-Map System**: ‚úÖ Core functions analyzed
- **Position Display**: ‚è≥ Pending analysis

### Validation Results

- SCEN WORK DISP confirmed functional via PCSX2 testing
- Real-time debug overlay displays enabled flags as `{index}:0(0)`
- Flag toggles have immediate effect on scene processing

## Development Workflow

### Analyzing New Functions

1. Identify function from `src/` directory
2. Gather context using `globals.json` cross-references
3. Analyze code patterns and variable usage
4. Create meaningful function name and documentation
5. Update callsites in `analyzed/` directory
6. Validate through emulator testing when possible

### Documentation Standards

- Maintain original `FUN_*` names in comments
- Use evidence-based analysis over speculation
- Document PS2-specific implementation details
- Include memory addresses and data structure layouts
- Provide PCSX2 debugging guidance

## Tools and Resources

### Analysis Tools

- **Ghidra**: Primary decompilation and reverse engineering
- **PCSX2**: PlayStation 2 emulator with debugging capabilities
- **globals.json**: Generated metadata for variable cross-referencing
- **Git**: Version control for tracking analysis progress

### Generated Data

- `src/`: Raw decompiled functions (gitignored)
- `globals.json`: Global variable metadata (gitignored)
- `analyzed/`: Clean, documented function implementations

### Search Techniques

Use terminal commands to search gitignored files:

```bash
grep -r "pattern" src/        # Search source files
grep "pattern" globals.json   # Search global metadata
```

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:

1. Follow the established format and structure
2. Include cross-references between related systems
3. Provide memory addresses and technical details
4. Update this README with new file descriptions
5. Validate information through code analysis or testing

## Technical Context

This reverse engineering effort focuses on understanding the sophisticated debug systems built into Orphen: Scion of Sorcery. The game contains extensive debugging functionality that was used during development, including:

- Real-time scene element visualization and control
- Position and coordinate debugging displays
- Mini-map development tools
- Comprehensive logging and output systems
- Developer-friendly menu interfaces

The analysis reveals high-quality, well-structured code optimized for PlayStation 2 hardware constraints while maintaining clean separation between debug and release functionality.
